    **Important Notes:**

    - Using threads for fuzzing is generally discouraged due to potential
      instability and increased complexity.
    - The `dangerous_characters` list and the custom sorting implemented
      using `bubble_sort` might require adjustments based on your specific
      fuzzing context and application.
